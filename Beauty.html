      <h1 class="w3-center"> 3 Natural ways to get glowing skin </h1>

    <!-- 5 natural ways to get glowing Skins -->
      <p class="w3-xxlarge" > 1. Honey </p>
      <p class="w3-large">Honey when taken internally and externally is excellent for the skin. For combination to dry skin types, take one teaspoon of honey and massage on the skin daily. Leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wash. Pat dry and you will see that not only is your skin softer but also glowing. Make sure you use raw honey both internally and externally in order to reap maximum benefits. Organic raw honey is easily available everywhere nowadays.</p>
      <p class="w3-xxlarge"> 2. Milk </p>
      <p class="w3-large"> I personally love this ingredient. Not only does it softens and nourishes the skin but also makes it sensuous and helps in de-tanning. Wipe your skin with full fat milk twice a day or just splash a small bowlful of cold milk on your skin and pat dry. Milk is known to be one of the best moisturisers for your skin. This one's a great home remedy for those who have a dry skin. Ensure that you apply it regularly. 
      <p class= "w3-xxlarge"> 3. Almond </p>
      <p class="w3-large"> Whether you are using pure almond oil or almond paste, both are excellent sources of Vitamin E, providing nourishment for your skin externally. For dehydrated and dry skin, first massage the face with one teaspoon almond oil and then make a paste of 10 almonds mixed with a little milk and scrub it gently onto the skin. Wash the face with milk and then water. Not only will this help patchy skin but will give the skin an youthful texture, something we are all in constant search of.</p>
